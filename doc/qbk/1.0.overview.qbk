[section Overview]
[block'''<?dbhtml stop-chunking?>''']

[/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Boost.Http.Proto is a portable, low-level C++ library which provides containers
and algorithms for implementing the HTTP/1.1 protocol described in the document
[@https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing],
henceforth referred to as __rfc7230__.

Boost.Http.Proto offers these features:

* Require only C++11
* Works without exceptions
* Fast compilation, few templates
* Strict compliance with __rfc7230__

[/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

[section Requirements]

* Requires Boost and a compiler supporting at least C++11
* Aliases for standard types use their Boost equivalents
* Link to a built static or dynamic Boost library, or use header-only (see below)
* Supports `-fno-exceptions`, detected automatically

[heading Header-Only]

To use the library as header-only; that is, to eliminate the requirement
to link a program to a static or dynamic Boost.URL library, simply place
the following line in [*exactly one] source file in your project.

[c++]
```
#include <boost/http_proto/src.hpp>
```

[heading Embedded]

Boost.Http.Proto works great on embedded devices.
It is designed to work without exceptions if desired.

[section Supported Compilers]

Boost.Http.Proto has been tested with the following compilers:

* clang: 3.8, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
* gcc: 4.8, 4.9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
* msvc: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3

[h3 Quality Assurance]

The development infrastructure for the library includes
these per-commit analyses:

* Coverage reports
* Compilation and tests on Drone.io

[h1 Credits]

This library wouldn't be where it is today without the help of
[@https://github.com/pdimov Peter Dimov]
for design advice and general assistance.
